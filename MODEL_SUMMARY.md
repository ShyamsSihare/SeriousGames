# Models implemented in repo (summary)

- Hybrid HMM–LSTM–CNN classifier (used for multimodal sequence classification). 
- Reinforcement learning: DQN-based Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment (DDA) simulations and Q-learning update rules (manuscript lists α=0.1, γ=0.6 in examples). 
- Forecasting: ARIMA(5,1,0) and neural forecasting (LSTM + dilated conv in pipeline). 
- Privacy modules: DP, FL, HE simulation code for privacy–utility evaluation.
